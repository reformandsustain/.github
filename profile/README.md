# Welcome to REFORM & SUSTAIN!

## We are a nonpartisan group of young environmental activists from Orange County, CA that aims to educate and connect young people to ways they can take action on environmental issues in Southern California and beyond!

### Our mission is to provide a welcoming space where we encourage young people to discover the role they can play in the environmental movement by providing educational resources on how they can take individual action and advocacy training so they can take collective action.
